# Pubchem Compounds Clustering `CODE BASE`
## Task 1
`Embedding of Compounds` \
\
For task 1 the workflows is as mentioned below:
Note : Download all the compound files from the PubChem database and extract them to SDF_BATCHES folder.
- 1: Run the `BATCH SPLITTING ROUTINE` from `main.py` file .Once that gets done SDF files will be visible in SDF_PER_COMPOUND folder.
- 2: Run the `MOL2VEC FEATURIZATION ROUTINE` from `main.py` file .Once that's gets done CSVs files will be available in CSVS folder.
- 3: Run the `MOL2VEC VECTORIZATION ROUTINE` from `main.py` file .Once that's gets done CSV file will be available in VECTORIZED_CSV folder.


#
## **Task 2**
`Dendogram Generation` \
\
For task 2 the workflows is as mentioned below:
- 1: Run the `clustering2.py` file .Once that's gets done Dendogram png file will be available in TEMP_TEST folder.

#### Nice to know
All the routines are well documented in case you want to see the work flow inside pipelines.
